# Balistic Calculator

## Lore

So, one day one friend asked me, If I could make some web page into native mobile app for offline use.
"Yeah okay, Just send me the link.", I replied.
"Done, I want just the interior balistic and penetration calculator"
"Balistic WHAT?", I already knew that Discord warned me about propability of him being a terrorist, but this was more than a warning.
"Don't worry about it, I won't use them to precisely calculate a tank head rotation needed for target anihilation.", with these words, he left.
[www.longrods.ch] is what he gave me. Page dedicated to balistics, tank missiles and research about them.
I almost fainted, what I saw was a typical 90' PHP stylish websise with the old <table> layout.
The worse was the legacy code. The penetration calculator used over 50 variables (in the format of <letter><digit>) and used illegal programming war crimes on daily basis.
Bit I accepted the challenge. I started refractoring. But the code fought back.
I heared a sound, sound of a beast, The Beast of the spagetti code. Scared, I tripped over a formula.
The formula doesn't work anymore, The Code doesn't work anymore! It's over.

Really? Over?

I started research. Research of The Creator's illegal practices. My knowledge grew.
I listened. I begun understading the voices and sounds of The Beast.
I explored more. Seeing places only The Creator has ever seen.
The Code, code of The Creator, It started make sense now! I knew!
I gently asked The Beast, to help it escape the eternal suffering.
I relieved. It's done, refractored, usable at it's state.
